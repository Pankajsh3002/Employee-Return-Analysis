## Key Insights
The Average Return Value has seen a significant YoY increase of 602%, suggesting that customers are returning higher-value items more frequently.

A noticeable spike in returns during August points to potential seasonal factors or issues related to specific promotions or products during that period.

By analyzing employee-level contributions, the business can identify individuals who may require additional training or auditing to reduce return rates.
